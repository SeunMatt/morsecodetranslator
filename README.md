English to Morse Code
---------------------
Type English text in the text area provided. When you press the space bar

the text will automatically be converted into Morse code and displayed on the text area to the right.

Each english character is separated by white space in morse code and space between English words is translated as '/' in the

You can clear the existing morse code in the text area with a button at the bottom of the app

Type the morse code in the text area to the right. 

Separate morse code for each letter by a space.

'/' denote a space between words.
