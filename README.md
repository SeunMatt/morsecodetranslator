=====================

A simple `Java` GUI Desktop App that can translate English text to Morse code and vice-versa.

How to run the application
==========================
1. Download java runtime environment (jre) version 8 [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) if you don't have it already
2. Double click on the executable jar file that can be found in target/morsecodetranslator-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

Usage Instruction
=================

English to Morse Code
---------------------
Type English text in the text area provided. When you press the space bar

the text will automatically be converted into Morse code and displayed on the text area to the right.

Each english character is separated by white space in morse code and space between English words is translated as '/' in the

generated morse code.

Morse Code to English

You can clear the existing morse code in the text area with a button at the bottom of the app

Type the morse code in the text area to the right. 

Separate morse code for each letter by a space.

'/' denote a space between words.
